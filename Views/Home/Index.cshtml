    <p>Top 3 Jobs:</p>

    <ul class="list-props">

    </ul>
    <p> For 413, I can't really say I have clear expectations. I had an awesome semester in the fall thanks to the amazing professors and TAs. Maybe I shouldn't say this, but I completely put it in their hands to know what I should get out of this class. I will work my asp off doing whatever they deem valuable to us. They say "dance", I say, "how high?" </p>
